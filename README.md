## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of AstroPaper, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash
/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── logo.svg
│   │   └── logo.png
│   └── favicon.svg
│   └── astropaper-og.jpg
│   └── robots.txt
│   └── toggle-theme.js
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── socialIcons.ts
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   │   |  blog/
│   │   |    └── some-blog-posts.md
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
│   └── styles/
│   └── utils/
│   └── config.ts
│   └── types.ts
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Running Locally

You can start using this project locally by running the following command in your desired directory:

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create astro@latest --template satnaing/astro-paper

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create astro@latest -- --template satnaing/astro-paper

# yarn
yarn create astro --template satnaing/astro-paper

# pnpm
pnpm dlx create-astro --template satnaing/astro-paper
```

> **_Warning!_** If you're using `yarn 1`, you might need to [install `sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install) as a dependency.

Then start the project by running the following commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm run install

# start running the project
npm run dev
```

As an alternative approach, if you have Docker installed, you can use Docker to run this project locally. Here's how:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t astropaper .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 4321:80 astropaper
```

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

> **_Note!_** For `Docker` commands we must have it [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) in your machine.
